# Mailjet Utils

![build_status](https://github.com/prio-data/cc_backend_lib/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

A small package / app I wrote to mock the Mailjet REST api for development. The
models might also be useful when working with the
[Mailjet python package](https://pypi.org/project/mailjet-rest/).
